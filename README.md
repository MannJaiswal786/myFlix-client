## Introduction to the project:
Downtown Cinema is a web application, developed using the MERN stack, that provides users with access to information about movies, directors, and genres. Users are able to create a list of favorite movies, delete them and also view their profile. The purpose and context of this project was to demonstrate my mastery of full stack JavaScript devlopment.

The aim of the project was to have an ambitious full-stack project that I can add to my professional portfolio. The problem I wanted to solve was to build the complete server-side and client-side for the application from scratch.

## High Level Functions:
### Main view
● Returns a list of ALL movies to the user (each listed item with an image, title, and description)
● Sorting and filtering
● Ability to select a movie for more details
### Single movie view
● Returns data (description, genre, director, image) about a single movie to the user
● Allows users to add a movie to their list of favorites
### Login view
● Allows users to log in with a username and password
● Registration view
● Allows new users to register (username, password, email, birthday)
### Genre view
● Returns data about a genre, with a name and description
● Displays example movies
### Director view
● Returns data about a director (name, bio, birth year, death year)
● Displays example movies
### Profile View
● Allows users to add/ remove a movie from their list of favorites

## Technical Requirements and Industry based practices used to develop the project:
* The application must be a single-page application (SPA) 
* The application must use state routing to navigate between views and share URLs 
* The application must give users the option to filter movies 
* The application must give users the option to sort movies 
* The application must initially use Parcel as its build tool 
* The application must be written using the React library and in ES2015+ 
* The application must use Bootstrap as a UI library for styling and responsiveness 
* The application must contain a mix of class components and function component

## Technologies Learned:
* Basic to Advanced Javascript
* Javascript Libraries and Frameworks
* Web Server Frameworks
* Node.js and Server-Side Programming
* Relational and Non-Relational Databases
* Data Visualization
* Functional and Object-Oriented Programming
* Web Ethics and Data Security
* Test-Driven Development
* Documentation, Handoffs, and Collaborative Working
Tech is where I want to be and due to such high demand for web developers, is the main reason I learned and practiced the above technologies and built a full stack application for my senior project. 

## Technical Approach:
### Server-Side:
I create a RESTful API using Node.js and Express, that interacts with a non-relational database (MongoDB). The API can be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET or POST. To retrieve data from and store data in database, CRUD methods are used. The API provides movie information in JSON format.

To text the API, I used Postman, I also included user authentication and authorization code in the form of basic HTTP authentication and JWT authentication.

### Client-Side:
After completing the API, I started to build the interface users would need when making requests to, and receiving responses from, the server side. It is a single-page, responsive application, developed with React. It provides several interface views, including, but not limited to, a main view (shows a list of all movies), single movie view (shows data about a single movie and allows users to add the movie to their list of favorites), a login view, registration view and a profile view (where users can update their user data and list of favorites).

## Challenges and Risks:
I faced a lot of challenges while building this application. Some of them include implementing JWT token authentication and authorization, styling implementation to front end and connecting databases particularly MongoDB as I had no experience in non relational databases. I overcame the challenges by communicating with my Professors and learning from my peers from class and collaboring on other projects to learn new technologies.

## Outstanding issues:
* Users must have to refresh the page to logout
* Users must refresh the webpage to add/remove favorite movies inside the favorites list

## How I could approach these problems:
I plan to use react redux in my project in summer to get the issues resolved. Thank you
