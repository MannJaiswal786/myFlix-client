# myFlix-client

## Introduction to the project:
Downtown Cinema is a web application, developed using the MERN stack, that provides users with access to information about movies, directors, and genres. Users are able to create a list of favorite movies, delete them and also view their profile. The purpose and context of this project was to demonstrate my mastery of full stack JavaScript devlopment.

The aim of the project was to have an ambitious full-stack project that I can add to my professional portfolio. The problem I wanted to solve was to build the complete server-side and client-side for the application from scratch.
