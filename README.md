# myFlix-client

## Introduction to the project:
Downtown Cinema is a web application, developed using the MERN stack, that provides users with access to information about movies, directors, and genres. Users are able to create a list of favorite movies, delete them and also view their profile. The purpose and context of this project was to demonstrate my mastery of full stack JavaScript devlopment.

The aim of the project was to have an ambitious full-stack project that I can add to my professional portfolio. The problem I wanted to solve was to build the complete server-side and client-side for the application from scratch.

## High Level Functions:
### Main view
● Returns a list of ALL movies to the user (each listed item with an image, title, and description)
● Sorting and filtering
● Ability to select a movie for more details
### Single movie view
● Returns data (description, genre, director, image) about a single movie to the user
● Allows users to add a movie to their list of favorites
### Login view
● Allows users to log in with a username and password
● Registration view
● Allows new users to register (username, password, email, birthday)
### Genre view
● Returns data about a genre, with a name and description
● Displays example movies
### Director view
● Returns data about a director (name, bio, birth year, death year)
● Displays example movies
### Profile View
● Allows users to add/ remove a movie from their list of favorites

## Technical Requirements used for building the project
● The application must be a single-page application (SPA)
● The application must use state routing to navigate between views and share URLs
● The application must give users the option to filter movies
● The application must give users the option to sort movies
● The application must initially use Parcel as its build tool
● The application must be written using the React library and in ES2015+
● The application must be written with React Redux (hence respecting the Flux pattern)
● The application must use Bootstrap as a UI library for styling and responsiveness
● The application must contain a mix of class components and function component
